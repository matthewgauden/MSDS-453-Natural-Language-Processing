# MSDS-453-Natural-Language-Processing

The goal of this course was to learn about NLP from a text analytics perspective. The course generally avoided the theoretical aspects of NLP, and focused on practical applications of NLP, specifically as it pertains to aritifical intelligence. For the final project, I built a recommendation system that performs a semantic-similarity search based on a user query, and recommends the top-5 most sold products within an Amazon Product Reviews dataset. A final report is also attached.
